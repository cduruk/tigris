Tigris
======

Tigris is a sample application whipped together to showcase Digg's new
Streaming API.

Setup
-----

It expects a browser that supports the (Server-Sent events)[1]. As of
this writing, Tigris works with Safari 5, Chrome 7+. It probably works
with Firefox 4.

It currently expects server-sent events be sent from `/digg/stream`. During
development, I setup a proxy with nginx, which worked great.

Meh.

Misc.
------

It is named after a Tigris river because I'm from Turkey and rivers stream.
